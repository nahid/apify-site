To use Apify, you need to have .NET 8.0 SDK installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-tester.git
cd api-tester

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

### Native AOT Compilation

Apify supports Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, which produces a self-contained executable with no dependency on the .NET runtime. This results in:

- Faster startup time
- Smaller deployment size
- No dependency on the .NET runtime
- Improved performance

To build the Native AOT version:

```bash
# Using the build script
./build-native.sh

# Or manually
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishAot=true
```

The resulting executable will be located at:
`bin/Release/net8.0/linux-x64/publish/apify`

You can run it directly without needing the .NET runtime:

```bash
./bin/Release/net8.0/linux-x64/publish/apify
```

#### Platform-Specific Builds

For other platforms, replace `linux-x64` with your target platform:

- Windows: `win-x64`
- macOS: `osx-x64`
- ARM64: `linux-arm64` or `osx-arm64`
