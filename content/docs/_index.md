Apify is a robust command-line tool designed for comprehensive API testing and mocking. It allows developers to define API tests in JSON format and execute them against endpoints, providing detailed output of the request, response, and test results. The tool offers centralized environment management, variable substitution, and support for various payload types and file uploads. It also includes a powerful mock server for simulating API responses during development and testing.
