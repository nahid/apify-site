Apify's Import & Export feature allows developers to seamlessly migrate API collections and environments between different tools. You can import collections and environments from Postman files directly into Apify, making it easy to get started with your existing API definitions. Additionally, you can export your Apify collections in formats compatible with Postman and Swagger, enabling smooth collaboration and integration with other API development workflows.
