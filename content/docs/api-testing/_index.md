Welcome to the API Testing section. Here you'll find everything you need to define, execute, and manage automated tests for your APIs using Apify.

## Overview

API testing is essential for ensuring your endpoints work as expected, handle edge cases, and remain reliable as your application evolves. Apify's API testing tools are designed to help you automate these checks, integrate them into your workflows, and gain confidence in your API's stability.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive HTTP Method Support**  
    Test all standard HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS.

- **Flexible Payload Handling**  
    Send requests with JSON, plain text, form data, or raw binary payloads. Easily test endpoints that require file uploads or complex data structures.

- **File Upload Testing**  
    Simulate multipart/form-data requests and verify file handling in your API.

- **Advanced Assertions**  
    Validate every aspect of the response:  
    - Status codes  
    - Headers  
    - Body content (including nested JSON properties, arrays, and specific values)  
    - Response time and performance

- **Chained Requests & Dynamic Data**  
    Chain multiple requests together, passing data from one response to the next. Test real-world API workflows and scenarios.

- **Environment & Variable Support**  
    Parameterize your tests with environment variables for flexible, reusable test cases.

- **Detailed Reporting**  
    Get clear, actionable feedback on test results, including logs, error messages, and performance metrics.
