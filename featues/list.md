  Based on common developer needs, here are a few ideas:

  1. Deeper Integration with API Specifications
   * OpenAPI/Swagger Import: The ability to generate a full set of mock APIs automatically by importing an openapi.json or swagger.yaml file. This would be a massive time-saver for teams that
     follow a design-first approach.
   * OpenAPI/Swagger Export: The reverse would also be valuable: automatically generating an OpenAPI specification file from the existing mock definitions. This would make documenting the API
     much easier.

  2. More Advanced and Stateful Mocking
   * Stateful Scenarios: The current mocks are mostly stateless (each call is independent). A powerful addition would be the ability to create stateful scenarios. For example:
       1. A POST /api/auth/register call actually "creates" a user in the mock server's memory.
       2. A subsequent POST /api/auth/login call with the same credentials would then succeed, while others would fail.
       3. A GET /api/me call would return the data for that specific logged-in user.
   * Dynamic Sequences: The ability to define a sequence of responses for the same endpoint. For instance, the first time you call GET /api/orders/123, it returns "status": "Processing", and
     the second time it returns "status": "Shipped".

  3. Enhanced Testing Capabilities
   * Contract Testing: A feature to run the defined API tests against a real backend implementation. This would validate that the actual API conforms to the contract defined in the mocks,
     preventing drift between the frontend/mock and the backend.
   * Scenario Testing: An easier way to define and run tests that involve a sequence of API calls (e.g., register, login, create order) to test a complete user flow.

  4. Better Developer Experience
   * Web UI: A simple web interface (that could be launched with a CLI command) to view incoming requests to the mock server in real-time, inspect payloads, and see which mock response was
     triggered. This would make debugging much faster.
   * Hot Reloading: Automatically restarting the mock server when a definition file is changed. (This may already be a feature, but if not, it's essential).

  Adding these features would evolve the tool from a great API mocker into a comprehensive API development and testing suite.
